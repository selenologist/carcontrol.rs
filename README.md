#carcontrol.rs

Controls a simple two-motor ESP8266 WiFi car over UDP with SDL2 for input.

Abandoned because I ordered continuous rotation servos for the (3d printed) car, but both vendors sent regular servos! ARGH!

So I have a functioning car, except its motors are not continuous rotation so it does not go anywhere. Great...
